# Homework-for-Week-1-eds223
This Repo covers the week 1 homework for Eds223 that I (Maeve) make in class, I use this to practice spatial imaging and R coding. There will be a Quarto document with the substantive components of the homework, and the data used (in a file called data). 

If a bug is spotted-shoot me an email (maeveli@ucsb.edu) and we can figure out together what's going on. Include the code ran, the error message recieved, and a screenshot of what you're working with. I'd appreciate it if you didn't contribute to this! Its my work for a class and a record of my process for research.
